These keywords could be used as auto-generated hashtags for twitter or instagram feeds; but generally help with discoverability of relevant imagery.

                        Known to some in the northern hemisphere as December's Cold Moon or the Long Night Moon, the last full moon of 2023 is rising in this surreal mountain and skyscape. The Daliesque scene was captured in a single exposure with
                         a camera and long telephoto lens near Monte Grappa, Italy. The full moon is not melting, though. Its stretched and distorted appearance near the horizon is caused as refraction along the line of sight changes and creates
                          shifting images or mirages of the bright lunar disk. The changes in atmospheric refraction correspond to atmospheric layers with sharply different temperatures and densities. Other effects of atmospheric refraction produced
                           by the long sight-line to this full moon rising include the thin red rim seen faintly on the distorted lower edge of the Moon and a thin green rim along the top.

                                    Atlas Centaur rockets have launched over 75 successful unmanned missions. These missions included the Surveyor series - the
                                     first vehicles to make soft landings on the Moon, Pioneer 10 and 11 - the first missions to fly by Jupiter and Saturn and the
                                      first man-made objects able to leave our Solar System, the Viking missions which landed on Mars, several satellites in the 
                                      High Energy Astrophysics Observatory (HEAO) series, Pioneer Venus which circled and mapped the surface of Venus, and numerous
                                       Intelsat satellites.   Of recent scientific interest was the Atlas launched SOHO mission which will continually observe the 
                                       Sun. Atlas rockets are manufactured by Lockheed Martin Co.
